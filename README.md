      Ciao! You've reached KrazyGyro via GitHub.

Hello, fellow GitHubian, and welcome to my profile! You may be wondering:

  "Why should I care about just another GitHub user?"

Well, let me get introductions out of the way.

I am KrazyGyro, but most people just call me "Krazy." I am a Super Mario 64 machinimist who loves to follow with community developments, which is why I am active on GitHub.

I hope to aspire as a machinima developer myself in the future, but for now you'll mainly see me reporting issues or starting discussions on several programs and softwares.

For now, farewell!
